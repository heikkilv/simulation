```

## Getting started

station1: `npm install` & `npm start`
backend: `npm install` & `npm run nodemon` and on another cmd line: `http-server --cors`

## Docker deployment

- To build images: `docker-compose build`
- To configure charging stations: edit [`db.json`](./db.json)
- To run: `docker-compose up`

## How to operate

The client runs at the address `localhost:3000`, where the user can set when the charging will be completed. After pressing the start button, the current power used by the station is sent to the server, located at `localhost:8888/activeStations`. Such data will be sent to the monitoring client `localhost:8080` and displayed in a pie chart.

## The algorithm

The power is distributed depending on the charging duration set by the user. The graphs below indicate such distribution and the corresponding battery percentage increase.
